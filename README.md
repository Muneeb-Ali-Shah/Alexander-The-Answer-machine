# Alexander-The-Answer-machine
We have created a program that we have named Alexander - the answer machine. In this, the user inputs a question, and Alexander provides an answer. For example, if I ask what color shirt I am wearing, Alexander will reveal the answer. Actually, it is not a mind reader but a prank game. In this game, you can ask random questions, and Alexander will answer, surprising the person in front of you. However, the secret behind it is known only to the person operating the program. If an ordinary person runs the program and asks Alexander a question, he will say, "I will answer my boss only." But if the person who knows how to operate the program runs it, they will provide the correct answer. Actually, the boss is the person who knows how to operate the program. The boss instructs the person asking the question to feed the answer in advance. Then, no matter what question is asked, the program prints the string that was previously fed.
